### Implementation Notes

**Provider Selection**:
- Bedrock chosen as primary provider for Claude 3 Sonnet capabilities
- SageMaker as fallback with BLIP model support
- Hugging Face as tertiary option for maximum availability

**Database Choice**:
- DynamoDB selected for serverless scaling and low latency
- Single-table design with GSI for flexible queries
- Point-in-time recovery enabled

**Scaling Decisions**:
- ECS Fargate for serverless compute
- Auto-scaling based on CPU (70%) and memory (80%)
- CloudFront for edge caching and global distribution

**Cost Optimizations**:
- Pay-per-request DynamoDB billing
- S3 lifecycle policies for storage tiering
- Fargate Spot instances considered for dev/staging
- CloudWatch log retention limited to 30 days

### Known Limitations

- Cognito social sign-in not configured (requires provider setup)
- Bedrock availability limited to specific regions
- Max image size limited to 10 MB
- Captions generated in English only (v1)
- No real-time caption streaming (future enhancement)

### Trade-offs

1. **Streamlit vs Custom React Frontend**:
   - ‚úÖ Pros: Rapid development, built-in components, Python-native
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Limited customization, websocket overhead
   - Decision: Streamlit for v1, React for v2 if needed

2. **Bedrock vs Self-hosted Models**:
   - ‚úÖ Pros: Managed service, no infrastructure, latest models
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Higher per-request cost, vendor lock-in
   - Decision: Bedrock for simplicity, SageMaker as alternative

3. **Fargate vs EC2/EKS**:
   - ‚úÖ Pros: Serverless, no management, quick scaling
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Higher cost per vCPU-hour
   - Decision: Fargate for operational simplicity

### Security Considerations

- All secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- No hardcoded credentials in repository
- IAM roles follow least-privilege principle
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Security scanning in CI pipeline

### Performance Characteristics

- **Caption Generation Latency**:
  - Bedrock: ~1-2 seconds
  - SageMaker: ~2-3 seconds
  - Hugging Face API: ~3-5 seconds

- **Throughput**:
  - Concurrent users: 100+ (with auto-scaling)
  - Requests per second: 10-20 sustained

- **Storage**:
  - Image retention: 90 days default
  - S3 lifecycle to Glacier after 60 days

### Next Recommended Improvements

1. **Features**:
   - Multi-language caption support
   - Batch upload capability
   - Caption editing and feedback
   - Social media sharing
   - Caption history search

2. **Technical**:
   - Redis caching layer
   - GraphQL API option
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Model fine-tuning pipeline
   - A/B testing framework

3. **Operations**:
   - Blue-green deployments
   - Canary releases
   - Cost optimization dashboard
   - Performance profiling
   - Chaos engineering tests

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Multi-language support
- Batch processing
